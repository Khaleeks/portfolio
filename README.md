# Personal Website Documentation

Hello! I’m Khaleeqa Aasiyah, a Computer Science major with a minor in Interactive Media. This website is my digital canvas, where I can showcase who I am and what I’m passionate about. It’s more than just a portfolio — it’s a reflection of my journey, my growth, and my vision as a creator. As I continue to evolve in both technical and creative aspects, this site will serve as a foundation, a starting block, for something I can continually expand upon and share with my future employers, colleagues, and collaborators.

## My Passion for Interactive Media and Web Development

From the very beginning, I knew I wanted to combine my love for technology and art. As a CS major, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood, but my minor in Interactive Media has allowed me to explore the creative side of technology. I’ve always had a passion for bringing experiences to life in new, dynamic ways. That’s why I chose to work with Three.js and WebGL. These tools allowed me to create an immersive 3D experiences that tells a story and engages with you all in a way that feels personal and meaningful.

The process of building this website has been incredibly rewarding. It’s been a journey of learning, experimenting, and creating. One of the most challenging yet exciting parts was rendering the bedroom scene. I started with a basic glb file that I found on the Three.js website, but it didn’t fully capture my vision. I had to dive into the code, modify the model, and make adjustments until it reflected the space I wanted to create. This experience taught me a lot about working with 3D assets, and the final result is something I’m genuinely proud of.

## Personal Touches, Interactivity, and Creative Features

This website isn’t just about showcasing my skills; it’s about infusing my personality into every pixel. One feature I’m particularly proud of is the light/dark mode switch, offering users a customizable experience. As someone who often works late into the night, I wanted to ensure the site is comfortable at any time of day. It’s a small touch that enhances usability and reflects my attention to detail.

Another feature I love is the rendered laptop that displays my projects. It’s not just a visual choice; it’s an interactive way to present my work, creating a personal, immersive experience. I wanted visitors to feel like they’re exploring my space, connecting with not just my work, but my approach to it.

Interactivity, for me, is about creating meaningful experiences. Features like the light/dark mode switch, the 3D bedroom, and the rendered laptop aren’t just functional; they help tell my story. These elements bring the site to life, reflecting my passion for both technology and creativity.

## Technical Foundations and Implementation

Behind the scenes, this site is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with each line of code carefully crafted to ensure smooth functionality and an intuitive experience. I’ve focused on organizing the markup for clarity, so not only is the site easy to navigate, but the structure is maintainable and scalable for future updates. The use of clean, well-commented code was something I prioritized to make sure that anyone working on or reviewing the project in the future can follow the logic easily. For me, it’s important that both the functionality and the aesthetic appeal of the website work in harmony, and I’ve worked hard to make sure the technical foundations reflect that balance. 

## Looking Toward the Future

This website is just the beginning of my journey as a developer. It’s a starting point where I can showcase my current skills, projects, and ideas, but I see it as a constantly evolving space. As I continue to grow and learn, I plan to keep adding new projects, features, and personal touches to this site. It will be a living reflection of my journey — one that allows me to share not just my technical capabilities, but my growth as a creator. I want this site to act as more than just a portfolio; it’s a place where I can document my experiences, highlight my creativity, and present my evolving skillset. As I look ahead, I’m excited to see how it will continue to grow and how it will play a part in my professional journey. This is my way of showing future employers who I am beyond what’s listed on a resume or LinkedIn profile. It’s a platform where I can highlight my evolution as a developer, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.
